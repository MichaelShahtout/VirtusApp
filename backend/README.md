# Virtus Back End

To start back-end alone, cd into this directory and run command `npm run dev` or `node .\server.js`

`npm run dev` runs the command `nodemon .\server.js`, which allows changes to scripts to refresh server automatically instead of having to restart it

Schema for data is found in the backend/models folder

# Server
